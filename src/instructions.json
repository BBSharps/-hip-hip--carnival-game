      "01": "When starting Cornival Conduct, you will be given 1000 coins to build your very own carnival. Click on one of the buildable squares and create your first stand. You will have a selection of 3 stand types to choose from. Attractions: the best for attracting visitors, but produce the least revenue. Prize Stalls: average at generating both visitors and coins. Confectionary: the best for generating revenue, but attract the least visitors.",
      "02": "Once you have chosen your first stand it will begin to generate coins and visitors. Click on your stand to see how it's doing. Stands have a built-in 'coins maximum'. Make sure to check in regularly to bank your coins and move them into your total coins stash. Stands also have a 'maintenance' value which will decrease over time and reduce the amount of coins and visitors it generates in the process. You can use your coins to pay for repairs on your stand at any time - but be careful with this, as a stand will shut down when it reaches 0% maintenance.",
      "03": "The game can last for up to 10 minutes. Run your carnival, build stands, generate coins to maintain and expand your range of stands, and try to attract as many visitors as possible before the time is up.",
      "04": "Good luck!"
